title: React Native SDK
description: Welcome to the Reclaim Protocol React Native SDK! You can use this SDK to implement Reclaim in your React Native applications. This SDK helps you create a simple process where users can prove their credentials from other websites, all without sharing sensitive information.

### Quick Start for Beginners

New to Reclaim? Here's how to get started:

1. [Installation](./react-native/installation)
   Get the SDK set up in your React Native project.

2. [Basic Example](./react-native/basic-example)
   Understand the basic flow on how to use the React Native SDK.

## How It Works

Here's a simplified flow of how Reclaim works in a typical React Native application:

1. **User Login**: A user logs into your app.
2. **Session Creation**: Your app creates a new Reclaim session.
3. **Request URL**: Your app generates a request URL. Display this to the user.
4. **User Interaction**: The user visits the request URL and logs into the target website (e.g., Amazon.com).
5. **Proof Generation**: A proof is created on the user's device.
6. **Proof Submission**: The user submits the proof to your application.
7. **Verification**: Your app verifies the proof and takes appropriate action.

## Choosing Your Implementation

- **Frontend-only**: Perfect for quick prototypes and MVPs. Implement Reclaim directly in your React Native app without backend changes.
- **Full Stack Implementation**: For production apps, we recommend using a backend implementation along with your React Native app for enhanced security and custom authentication.
