### Understanding How Reclaim Works

Reclaim follows a straightforward flow in React Native applications:

1. **User Login**
   - User authenticates in your application

2. **Session Creation**
   - Your application initializes a new Reclaim session

3. **Request URL Generation**
   - Application generates a unique request URL
   - Present this URL to your user

4. **User Authentication**
   - User navigates to the request URL
   - Authenticates with the target platform (e.g., Amazon.com)

5. **Proof Generation**
   - System creates a cryptographic proof on user's device

6. **Proof Submission**
   - User submits the generated proof to your application

7. **Verification Process**
   - Your application verifies the proof
   - Executes appropriate business logic based on verification results
