---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Node.js (version 14 or later) installed on your system
- npm (usually comes with Node.js) or yarn as your package manager
- A React Native project set up (if you haven't created one yet, follow the [React Native CLI Quickstart](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup))

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install the SDK

Open your terminal and navigate to your React Native project directory. Then run one of the following commands:

Using npm:
```bash
npm install @reclaimprotocol/reactnative-sdk
```

Using yarn:
```bash
yarn add @reclaimprotocol/reactnative-sdk
```

This command will download and install the Reclaim Protocol SDK and its dependencies into your project.

### 2. Verify Installation

To ensure the SDK was installed correctly, you can check your `package.json` file. You should see `@reclaimprotocol/reactnative-sdk` listed in the `dependencies` section.

## Importing the SDK

After installation, you can import the SDK in your JavaScript or TypeScript files. Here's how:

```javascript
import { ReclaimProofRequest } from '@reclaimprotocol/reactnative-sdk';
```

For CommonJS environments, you can use:

```javascript
const { ReclaimProofRequest } = require('@reclaimprotocol/reactnative-sdk');
```

## Next Steps

Congratulations! You've successfully installed the Reclaim Protocol React Native SDK. Here's what you can do next:

1. Check out the [Basic Example](./basic-example) guide to create your first proof request.
3. Learn about [Advanced Configuration](../advance-configurations/advance-options) options to customize the SDK for your needs.
