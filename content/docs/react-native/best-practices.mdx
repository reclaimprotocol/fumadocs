title: Best Practices
description: Welcome to our best practices guide! These recommendations will help you use the Reclaim Protocol React Native SDK securely and efficiently in your mobile applications.
---

### 1. Protect Your Application Secret

<Callout type="warning">
  Never include your Application Secret in your React Native app's code. This is crucial for maintaining the security of your application.
</Callout>

Key security measures:
- Store your `APP_SECRET` exclusively on your backend server
- Use environment variables or secure storage solutions for sensitive information like `APP_ID`
- Implement secure secret rotation practices

### 2. Secure Communication

Implement secure data transmission:
- Use HTTPS for all network communications
- Enable SSL/TLS certificate validation
- Implement certificate pinning for additional security
- Encrypt sensitive data before transmission

### 3. API Security Implementation

Protect your API endpoints with:
- Strong authentication mechanisms
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and sanitization

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Error Handling Strategy

Implement comprehensive error handling to enhance reliability:

```javascript
try {
  // Reclaim SDK operations
} catch (error) {
  // Handle errors appropriately
  console.error('Reclaim SDK error:', error);
  // Show user-friendly error message
}
```

### 2. SDK Maintenance

<Callout type="info">
  Regularly update the SDK to ensure you have the latest features and security improvements.
</Callout>

Update commands:
```bash
npm update @reclaimprotocol/reactnative-sdk
# or
yarn upgrade @reclaimprotocol/reactnative-sdk
```

## Performance Optimization

### 1. Network Request Management
- Implement request batching where possible
- Use appropriate caching strategies
- Monitor network performance metrics
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed requests

### 2. Asynchronous Operations

Optimize application responsiveness:

```javascript
const getRequestUrl = async () => {
  try {
    const result = await reclaimProofRequest.getRequestUrl();
    // Use the result
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle error
  }
};
```

## Quality Assurance

### 1. Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for SDK interactions
- End-to-end testing for critical flows
- Cross-device compatibility testing

### 2. Monitoring and Analytics
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Track key performance indicators (KPIs)
- Monitor error rates and patterns
- Set up automated alerts for critical issues

## User Experience Guidelines

### 1. User Interface Design
- Provide clear, step-by-step instructions
- Use consistent visual feedback
- Implement intuitive error messages
- Design for accessibility

### 2. Fallback Mechanisms
- Implement graceful degradation
- Provide clear alternative paths
- Handle offline scenarios effectively

### 3. Loading State Management

```jsx
const [isLoading, setIsLoading] = useState(false);

// ...

{isLoading ? (
  <ActivityIndicator size="large" color="#0000ff" />
) : (
  // Your verification UI
)}
```

### 4. Responsive Design
- Use flexible layouts
- Implement proper scaling
- Test on various screen sizes
- Support both portrait and landscape modes

### 5. Platform-Specific Considerations
- Respect platform conventions
- Implement platform-specific UI patterns
- Handle platform-specific permissions properly
- Test thoroughly on both iOS and Android
