### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Dart SDK (latest stable version)
- An IDE (e.g., Android Studio, VS Code) with Flutter and Dart plugins installed

## Installation Steps

### 1. Add the SDK to Your Project

Open your `pubspec.yaml` file and add the Reclaim Protocol SDK under the `dependencies` section:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  reclaim_sdk: ^latest_version  # Replace with the latest version
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command in your terminal to fetch and install the SDK:

```bash

## Verifying Installation

To ensure the SDK was installed correctly, you can check your `pubspec.lock` file. You should see `reclaim_flutter_sdk` listed with the version you specified.

## Importing the SDK

After installation, you can import the SDK in your Dart files. Here's how:

```dart
import 'package:reclaim_sdk/reclaim.dart';
```
