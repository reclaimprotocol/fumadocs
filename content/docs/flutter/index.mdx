# Quick Start Guide: Reclaim Flutter SDK

## Getting Started
Start building with Reclaim in just a few simple steps:

1. [Installation](./flutter/installation)
   - Set up the Reclaim Flutter SDK in your project

2. [Flutter Example](./flutter/flutter-example)
   - Learn core concepts and implementation basics

## Understanding the Flow
Here's how Reclaim integrates with your Flutter application:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Opens App] --> B[Create Reclaim Session]
    B --> C[Generate Request URL]
    C --> D[User Authentication]
    D --> E[Proof Generation]
    E --> F[Submit Proof]
    F --> G[Verification]
```

1. **Initial Access**: User launches your Flutter application
2. **Session Initialization**: Your app creates a new Reclaim session
3. **URL Generation**: System generates a secure request URL
4. **Authentication Flow**: User authenticates on the target platform (e.g., Amazon.com)
5. **Proof Creation**: System generates a cryptographic proof on the user's device
6. **Proof Handling**: User submits the proof back to your application
7. **Validation**: Your app verifies the proof's authenticity
