title: Flutter SDK
description: Welcome to the Reclaim Protocol Flutter SDK! This SDK allows you to seamlessly integrate Reclaim functionality into your Flutter applications for both Android and iOS. With our Flutter SDK, you can easily implement a secure process for users to prove their credentials from other websites without sharing sensitive information.

## Quick Start for Beginners

New to Reclaim? Here's how to get started with the Flutter SDK:

1. [Installation](./flutter/installation)
   Learn how to add the Reclaim Flutter SDK to your project.

2. [Flutter Example](./flutter/flutter-example)
   Understand the fundamental concepts and basic flow of using the Flutter SDK.

## How It Works

Here's a simplified flow of how Reclaim works in a typical Flutter application:

1. **User Interaction**: A user opens your Flutter app.
2. **Session Creation**: Your app creates a new Reclaim session.
3. **Request URL**: Your app generates a request URL and navigates the user to it.
4. **Web Authentication**: The user visits the request URL and logs into the target website (e.g., Amazon.com).
5. **Proof Generation**: A proof is created on the user's device.
6. **Proof Submission**: The user submits the proof back to your Flutter app.
7. **Verification**: Your app verifies the proof and takes appropriate action.

## Choosing Your Implementation

- **Mobile-only**: Ideal for quick prototypes and MVPs. Implement Reclaim directly in your Flutter app without backend changes.
- **Full Stack Implementation**: For production apps, we recommend using a backend implementation along with your Flutter app for enhanced security and custom authentication.
