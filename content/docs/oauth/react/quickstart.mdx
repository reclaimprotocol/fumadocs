description: Get up and running with Reclaim Auth React in your application quickly.

### Important Notes

> **Current Implementation Details**
> - Uses popup-based authentication flow (redirect-based flow coming soon)
> - Implements Authorization Code Grant (PKCE implementation coming soon)
> - Redirect URI is required as a security measure to prevent unauthorized applications from initiating the auth flow
> - The authentication happens in a popup window which closes automatically after completion

## Create Your Application

1. Go to the [Reclaim Identity Dashboard](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/new-application)

2. Click on "Create New Application"

3. Fill in your application details:
   - **Basic Information**: Enter the basic details of your application.
   - **Identity Providers**: Select the identity providers you want to include in your application. You can think of identity providers as 
   ways to identify the user, for example if you include Google as a provider the user will be asked to login with google in the first screen of
   the auth pop-up.
   - **Additional Providers**: You can request additional data from the user, the user will be asked to generate a proof for each of the selected
   additional providers.
   - **Redirect URIs**: Add authorized redirect URIs for your application. This is a required security measure.
     - For local development: `http://localhost:3000`
     - For production: `https://yourdomain.com`
     > Note: While the current flow uses popups, the redirect URI is still required as a security measure to verify the application's identity.

4. Click "Create Application" and save your credentials:
   - Note your **Application ID** (this will be your clientId)
   - Note your **Application Secret** (this will be you clientSecret)

## Installation

```bash
npm install identity-react
# or
yarn add identity-react
```

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in your project root:

```env
REACT_APP_RECLAIM_CLIENT_ID=your_application_id
REACT_APP_RECLAIM_CLIENT_SECRET=you_client_secret
REACT_APP_RECLAIM_REDIRECT_URI=your_redirect_uri
```

## Basic Implementation

Here's a minimal example to get authentication working:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import getReclaimAuth, { ReclaimUser } from 'identity-react';

const auth = getReclaimAuth(
  process.env.REACT_APP_RECLAIM_CLIENT_ID,
  process.env.REACT_APP_RECLAIM_CLIENT_SECRET,
  process.env.REACT_APP_RECLAIM_REDIRECT_URI
);

function App() {
  const [user, setUser] = React.useState<ReclaimUser | null>(null);
  React.useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribe = auth.onAuthStateChanged(setUser);
    return () => unsubscribe();
  }, []);

  const handleSignIn = async () => {
    try {
      await auth.signIn();
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('Sign in failed:', error);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {user ? (
      <div>
        <p>Welcome, {user.id}!</p>
        <pre>{JSON.stringify(user.userData, null, 2)}</pre>
        <pre>{JSON.stringify(user.additionalData, null, 2)}</pre>
      </div>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={handleSignIn}>Sign In</button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Testing Your Integration

1. Start your development server:
```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

2. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

3. Click the "Sign In" button

4. You should see:
   - A popup window for authentication
   - Redirect back to your application
   - User information displayed

## Next Steps

- [Authentication hooks](/oauth-react/hooks)

## Common Issues

### Popup Blocked
If the authentication popup is blocked, ensure your users:
- Have popups enabled for your domain
- Are clicking the sign-in button (popups triggered on page load are often blocked)

### Redirect URI Mismatch
If you get a redirect URI mismatch error:
- Verify the URI in your dashboard matches exactly with your environment variable
- Check for trailing slashes
- Ensure the protocol (http/https) matches

### CORS Issues
If you're getting CORS errors:
- Check that your domain is properly configured in the dashboard
- Ensure you're using the correct environment URLs
- Verify your redirect URI is properly whitelisted
