## Create Your Application

1. Go to the [Reclaim Identity Dashboard](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/new-application)

2. Click on "Create New Application"

3. Fill in your application details:
   - **Basic Information**: Enter the basic details of your application.
   - **Identity Providers**: Select the identity providers you want to include in your application. You can think of identity providers as 
   ways to identify the user, for example if you include Google as a provider the user will be asked to login with google in the first screen of
   the auth pop-up.
   - **Additional Providers**: You can request additional data from the user, the user will be asked to generate a proof for each of the selected
   additional providers.
   - **Redirect URIs**: Add your application domain (required for security validation)
     - For local development: `http://localhost:3000`
     - For production: `https://yourdomain.com`

4. Click "Create Application" and save your credentials:
   - Note your **Application ID** (this will be your clientId)
   - Note your **Application Secret** (this will be you clientSecret)

## Installation

### Using NPM
```bash
npm install reclaim-identity-js
```

### Using CDN
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/reclaim-identity-js@latest"></script>
```

## Basic Implementation

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Reclaim Auth Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
    <button id="loginBtn">Sign In</button>
    <div id="userInfo"></div>

    <script src="https://unpkg.com/reclaim-identity-js@latest"></script>
    <script>
        const clientId = 'your-client-id';
        const clientSecret = 'your-client-secret'
        const redirectUri = 'your-redirect-uri';
        const reclaimAuth = getReclaimAuth(clientId, clientSecret,redirectUri);

        // Handle auth state changes
        reclaimAuth.onAuthStateChanged(user => {
            const userInfo = document.getElementById('userInfo');
            if (user) {
                userInfo.textContent = JSON.stringify(user, null, 2);
            } else {
                userInfo.textContent = 'No user signed in';
            }
        });

        // Handle sign in
        document.getElementById('loginBtn').onclick = async () => {
            try {
                const user = await reclaimAuth.signIn();
                console.log('Signed in:', user);
            } catch (error) {
                console.error('Sign in failed:', error);
            }
        };
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

## Auth Flow

1. User clicks the sign-in button
2. A popup window opens with the authentication flow
3. User completes authentication in the popup
4. Popup automatically closes
5. Main application receives the authentication result
6. User session is established

## Testing Your Integration

1. Host your HTML file (using a local server for development):
```bash
npx serve .
```

2. Open your browser to the local server URL (typically `http://localhost:3000`)

3. Click the "Sign In" button

4. Complete the authentication in the popup window

## Common Issues

### Popup Blocked
If the authentication popup is blocked:
- Ensure popups are enabled for your domain
- Sign-in must be triggered by a user action (click)
- Check browser console for popup blocker warnings

### CORS Issues
If you're getting CORS errors:
- Verify your domain is properly configured in the dashboard
- Check that you're using the correct environment URLs
