import { Step, Steps } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/steps';

## Pre-requisite

- Before proceeding, ensure familiarity with ReactJs development as described
  [here](/js/frontend-example).

- You can access the code of this walkthrough on [Gitlab](https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/integrations/onchain/pluts-sdk).

## Overview

This walkthrough demonstrates how to integrate Reclaim Protocol proofs with decentralized identity (DID) and verifiable credentials (VCs) using Atala PRISM/Hyperledger Identus. Once a Reclaim Proof is generated, we use it to:

1. Create a DID.
2. Issue a Verifiable Credential (VC) tied to that Proof.
3. Incorporate the DID and VC into the transaction's datum before locking.
4. During unlocking, verify the VC on-chain before granting access.

By coupling these steps, we ensure that not only is the proof cryptographically valid, but it is also bound to a self-sovereign identity and a tamper-evident credential. This greatly enhances trust and security in decentralized identity workflows on the Cardano blockchain.

## Dapp Development

<Steps>

### 1. Cloning the `Dapp` repo.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.reclaimprotocol.org/integrations/onchain/pluts-sdk

cd pluts-sdk

npm install
```

### 2. Code Discovery: `lockTx.ts`

**Primary Functionality:**

- Prepares and locks the transaction that holds the proof, DID, and VC.

**Key Steps:**

- **Get Proof from Reclaim**: Retrieve the proof generated off-chain.
- **Create DID & VC**: Use the proof to create a Decentralized Identifier and issue a Verifiable Credential using Atala PRISM/Identus before locking.
- **Add to Datum**: Incorporate the DID and VC data into the transaction datum, ensuring that both the proof and associated identity credentials are recorded on-chain.
- **Lock Transaction**: Sign and submit the lock transaction, making the proof-backed VC accessible only to the rightful owner’s DID.

Functions:

- `getLockTx`: Builds the locking transaction, including proof and VC data.
- `lockTx`: Signs and submits the locked transaction to the blockchain.

### 3. Code Discovery: `unlockTx.ts`

**Primary Functionality:**

- Handles the unlocking process by verifying the proof and the associated VC on-chain.

**Key Steps:**

- **Fetch On-Chain Data**: Retrieve the DID and VC from the locked UTxO.
- **Verify VC**: Ensure the Verifiable Credential (issued during the locking step) is valid and corresponds to the DID owner attempting the unlock.
- **Unlock Transaction**: Once verified, proceed to sign and submit the unlocking transaction, releasing assets and confirming ownership.

Functions:

- `getUnlockTx`: Assembles the transaction required to unlock assets after verifying the VC.
- `unlockTx`: Signs and submits the unlock transaction to the blockchain.

### 4. Code Discovery: `reclaimPlutus.ts`

**Description:**

- Defines the smart contract logic for validation.
- Ensures that the DID, VC, and proof embedded in the datum meet the required unlocking conditions.

**Components:**

- **Datum & Redeemer**: Data formats that the validator uses to verify if the transaction (with the included DID and VC) meets the unlocking criteria.
- **scriptTestnetAddr**: The testnet address where the contract runs, ensuring that all transactions occur in the correct environment.

### 5. Verification Flow

**Connect Wallet**

Use Nami or another Cardano-compatible wallet set to the testnet environment.

**Generate Proof**

Scan the provided QR code or initiate the Reclaim App process to produce a zero-knowledge proof.

**Lock Proof with DID & VC**

- After generating the proof, create your DID and issue a VC from that proof using Atala PRISM/Identus.
- Include the DID and VC in the datum during the `lockTx` process.
- Submit the lock transaction, thereby publishing the proof and identity credentials on-chain.

**Verify by Unlocking**

- To unlock, the DApp fetches the DID and VC from the on-chain datum.
- Verifies the authenticity of the VC and checks that it belongs to the wallet’s DID.
- If verified, proceed with `unlockTx` to release funds and confirm rightful ownership.

### Contract Deployment

- Contract is deployed on the testnet. you can find the contract address [here](https://preprod.cardanoscan.io/address/addr_test1wzv5v4jx3xaz4nlgp6j6juw707huauprhfdkst66mlh0fcsgk7uvw).

## Summary

This documentation outlines how to:

- Generate a Reclaim proof and transform it into a DID and a Verifiable Credential using Atala PRISM/Hyperledger Identus.
- Lock this credentialized proof on-chain with a Plutus smart contract.
- Verify the DID and VC upon unlocking, ensuring that only an authenticated entity can reclaim the locked assets.
