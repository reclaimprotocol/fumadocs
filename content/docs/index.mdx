## Documentation

### Overview

Reclaim Protocol enables secure data portability across web, mobile, and blockchain platforms. Through our SDKs, developers can build applications that access authenticated user data, activity history, and identity information from various internet services - all while maintaining user privacy and security.

### Key Features

- Cross-platform SDK support (Web, Mobile, Blockchain)
- Zero-knowledge proof generation for data verification
- No user-side installations required (no apps or browser extensions)
- Secure HTTPS/TLS-based data transfer
- Extensive data provider network

### Use Cases

Our protocol enables various applications, including:
- **Transportation**: Import ride-sharing history from services like Uber to power new mobility platforms
- **E-commerce**: Leverage purchase history from platforms like Amazon for personalized recommendations
- **Blockchain**: Bridge off-chain activity data to power on-chain economics
- **Identity Verification**: Facilitate KYC processes using verified national ID data
- **Custom Solutions**: Build specialized data providers using our [developer tools](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org)

### Technical Architecture

Reclaim Protocol operates by:
1. Generating cryptographic proofs from HTTPS traffic
2. Implementing zero-knowledge proofs to ensure data privacy
3. Building on established standards (HTTPS, TLS)
4. Enabling selective data sharing controlled by users
