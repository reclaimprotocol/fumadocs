## Quick Start Guide for Reclaim

Welcome to Reclaim! This guide will help you get started with implementing Reclaim in your application.

### Getting Started

Follow these two simple steps to begin:

1. [Install the SDK](./js/installation)
   - Set up the Reclaim SDK in your project
   - Follow our step-by-step installation guide

2. [Try the Frontend Example (React)](./js/frontend-example)
   - Learn the basic implementation flow
   - See the SDK in action with React

### Understanding How Reclaim Works

Reclaim follows this straightforward flow in web applications:

1. **User Login** → User authenticates on your website
2. **Session Creation** → Your application initiates a new Reclaim session
3. **Request URL Generation** → Your site creates and displays a request URL
4. **User Authentication** → User visits the request URL and logs into the target platform (e.g., Amazon.com)
5. **Proof Generation** → System creates a proof on the user's device
6. **Proof Submission** → User submits the generated proof
7. **Verification** → Your application verifies the proof and processes the result

### Implementation Options

Choose the approach that best fits your needs:

### Frontend-only Implementation
- Ideal for: Prototypes and MVPs
- Benefits: Quick setup, minimal configuration
- Use when: Rapid development is priority
