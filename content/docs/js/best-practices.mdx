## Security Best Practices

### 1. Protect Your Application Secret

<Callout type="warning">
  Never expose your Application Secret in client-side code or public repositories. This is crucial for maintaining the security of your application.
</Callout>

- Store your `APP_SECRET` securely on your server using secure key management systems
- Use environment variables to manage sensitive information like `APP_ID` and `APP_SECRET`
- Implement secure rotation policies for your secrets
- Consider using secret management services like AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault

### 2. Use HTTPS

Always use HTTPS for all communications to ensure end-to-end encryption:
- Configure SSL/TLS certificates properly
- Enable HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)
- Regularly update your SSL certificates
- Use modern TLS versions (1.2 or higher)

### 3. Implement Rate Limiting

Protect your API endpoints with comprehensive rate limiting:
- Set appropriate request limits per IP/user
- Implement exponential backoff for repeated requests
- Use token bucket or sliding window algorithms
- Monitor and log rate limit violations

## Implementation Best Practices

### 1. Implement Proper Error Handling

Build robust error handling mechanisms:
```javascript
try {
  // Your verification logic
} catch (error) {
  if (error.name === 'ValidationError') {
    // Handle validation errors
  } else if (error.name === 'NetworkError') {
    // Handle network issues
  } else {
    // Handle unexpected errors
  }
}
```

### 2. Keep the SDK Updated

<Callout type="info">
  Regularly update the SDK to ensure you have the latest features and security improvements.
</Callout>

Update the SDK using npm:
```bash
npm update @reclaimprotocol/js-sdk
```

Set up automated dependency updates using tools like Dependabot or Renovate.

## Performance Best Practices

### 1. Optimize API Calls

Implement efficient API usage patterns:
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Batch related API calls where possible
- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Use connection pooling for database operations

### 2. Use Asynchronous Operations

Leverage asynchronous programming effectively:
- Implement Promise-based operations
- Use async/await for better readability
- Handle concurrent operations efficiently
- Avoid blocking operations in critical paths

## Testing and Monitoring

### 1. Implement Comprehensive Testing

Establish a robust testing strategy:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for SDK interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Performance tests for load handling
- Security tests for vulnerability checking

### 2. Monitor SDK Usage

Implement comprehensive monitoring:
- Track key performance metrics
- Set up alerting for critical issues
- Monitor error rates and latency
- Use logging for debugging and auditing

<Callout type="info">
  Implement structured logging and use APM (Application Performance Monitoring) tools to track SDK performance effectively.
</Callout>

## User Experience Best Practices

### 1. Provide Clear Instructions

Create an intuitive user experience:
- Use clear, concise language
- Provide step-by-step guidance
- Include progress indicators
- Offer contextual help where needed

### 2. Implement Graceful Fallbacks

Design resilient user flows:
- Provide clear error messages
- Offer retry options
- Implement offline capabilities where possible
- Create alternative verification paths

### 3. Optimize Loading States

Enhance perceived performance:
- Use skeleton screens for loading states
- Implement progressive loading
- Show meaningful progress indicators
- Provide estimated completion times
