description: This guide will walk you through the fundamental steps to integrate Reclaim's proof verification system into your React application.
---

### Prerequisites

Before implementing Reclaim verification in your React application, ensure you have:

- Successfully installed the Reclaim SDK (refer to the [Installation Guide](./installation))
- Obtained your credentials from the [Reclaim Developer Portal](https://dev.reclaimprotocol.org/):
  - Application ID
  - Application Secret
  - Provider ID

<Callout type="warning">
‚ö†Ô∏è Security Critical: Your Application Secret must be kept secure and should never be exposed in client-side code. Store it securely on your backend server.
</Callout>

## Implementation Guide

The following example demonstrates how to create a React component that implements Reclaim verification with QR code functionality:

```javascript

```

### Implementation Breakdown

#### 1. Component Architecture
The component is structured around three main elements:
- State management for verification URL and proofs
- Verification request handling
- User interface rendering

#### 2. Verification Process Flow

a. **Initialization**
- User triggers verification by clicking the button
- SDK initializes with your credentials
- Request URL is generated and stored in state

b. **Session Management**
- Component begins monitoring for proof submissions
- Handles both success and error scenarios
- Supports multiple response formats (string and object)

c. **User Interface**
- Displays verification button
- Shows QR code when URL is available
- Presents verification results

#### 3. Response Handling

The component handles two types of proof responses:
- String responses (when using custom callback URLs)
- Object responses (when using default callback URL)

### Integration Steps

1. **Component Integration**
```jsx
import ReclaimDemo from './ReclaimDemo';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Reclaim Verification</h1>
      <ReclaimDemo />
    </div>
  );
}
```

2. **Environment Setup**
- Store your credentials securely
- Configure error handling
- Set up appropriate loading states

- Desktop: Display QR code for mobile scanning
- Mobile: Show direct verification link
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
üîí Production Security Requirements:
1. Never expose APP_SECRET in frontend code
2. Generate request configurations server-side
3. Use `fromJsonString()` method in frontend code
4. Implement proper error handling and validation

Refer to the [Fullstack Example](./fullstack-example) for secure implementation details.

## Next Steps

After implementing the basic verification:

1. **Advanced Configuration**
   - Explore [Advanced Configuration Options](../advance-configurations/advance-options)
   - Customize SDK behavior for your use case

2. **Optimization**
   - Review [Best Practices](./best-practices)
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add loading states and user feedback

3. **Testing**
   - Test across different devices and browsers
   - Verify error scenarios
   - Validate security measures
