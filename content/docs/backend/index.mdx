# Reclaim Protocol JavaScript SDK for Backend

Welcome to the Reclaim Protocol JavaScript SDK for backend Node.js applications! This SDK helps you implement Reclaim in your server-side applications, allowing users to prove their credentials from other websites without sharing sensitive information.

## Quick Start for Beginners

New to Reclaim? Here's how to get started with the backend implementation:

1. [Installation](./backend/installation)
   Learn how to set up the SDK in your Node.js project.

2. [Backend Example](./backend/backend-example)
   Understand the basic flow of using the JS SDK in a backend environment.

## How It Works

Here's a simplified flow of how Reclaim works in a typical backend application:

1. **User Request**: A user requests to prove their credentials.
2. **Backend Configuration**: Your server creates a `reclaimProofRequestConfig` object with the necessary parameters.
3. **Config Transmission**: The server sends the `reclaimProofRequestConfig` to the frontend.
4. **Frontend Initialization**: The frontend initializes the Reclaim SDK using the received `reclaimProofRequestConfig`.
5. **Request URL Generation**: The frontend generates a request URL using the initialized SDK.
6. **User Interaction**: The user visits the request URL and logs into the target website (e.g., Amazon.com).
7. **Proof Generation**: A proof is created on the user's device.
8. **Proof Submission**: The user submits the proof to your server.
9. **Verification**: Your server verifies the proof and takes appropriate action.

## Why Use Backend Implementation?

Using Reclaim in your backend offers several advantages:

- **Enhanced Security**: Keep sensitive operations server-side.
- **Custom Authentication**: Integrate with your existing auth system.
- **Scalability**: Handle multiple users and requests efficiently.
- **Data Management**: Store and process proofs securely on your server.
