## Reclaim Protocol JavaScript SDK for Backend

### Overview
The Reclaim Protocol JavaScript SDK enables Node.js backend applications to verify user credentials from external websites while maintaining privacy and security. This documentation guides you through implementation, from basic setup to advanced features.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js environment
- Basic understanding of authentication flows
- npm or yarn package manager

### Quick Start Guide

1. [Installation Guide](./backend/installation)
   - Complete setup instructions for your Node.js project

2. [Basic Implementation](./backend/backend-example)
   - Step-by-step guide with practical examples

## Understanding the Flow

The Reclaim verification process follows these key steps:

1. **Initial Request**
   - User initiates credential verification
   - Backend prepares verification parameters

2. **Configuration Setup**
   ```javascript
   // Server creates configuration object
   const reclaimProofRequestConfig = {
     // Configuration parameters
   };
   ```

3. **Frontend Integration**
   - Backend transmits configuration to frontend
   - Frontend initializes SDK with received parameters

4. **User Authentication**
   - User accesses generated verification URL
   - Authenticates with target platform (e.g., Amazon.com)

5. **Proof Processing**
   - Proof generation on user device
   - Secure submission to your server
   - Backend verification and response

## Benefits of Backend Implementation
