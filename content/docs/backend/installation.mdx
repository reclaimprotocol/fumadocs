## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- Node.js (version 14 or later) installed on your system
- npm (usually comes with Node.js) or yarn as your package manager

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install the SDK

This command will download and install the Reclaim Protocol JavaScript SDK and its dependencies into your backend project.

### 2. Verify Installation

To ensure the SDK was installed correctly, you can check your `package.json` file. You should see `@reclaimprotocol/js-sdk` listed in the `dependencies` section.

## Importing the SDK in Node.js

After installation, you can import the SDK in your Node.js files. Here's how:

```javascript
const { ReclaimProofRequest } = require('@reclaimprotocol/js-sdk');
```
