### Installing the Reclaim Protocol JavaScript SDK for Backend

This guide explains how to integrate the Reclaim Protocol JavaScript SDK into your Node.js backend project. Follow these steps to set up the SDK and start building with Reclaim Protocol.

## Prerequisites

Before installation, ensure your development environment meets these requirements:

- Node.js installed (version 14.x or later)
- Package manager: npm (v6.x or later) or yarn (v1.22.x or later)
- A Node.js backend project initialized with a `package.json` file

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install the SDK

Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal and execute one of these commands:

Using npm:
```bash
npm install @reclaimprotocol/js-sdk
```

Using yarn:
```bash
yarn add @reclaimprotocol/js-sdk
```

### 2. Verify Installation

Confirm successful installation by:
- Checking your `package.json` file for the entry: `"@reclaimprotocol/js-sdk": "^x.x.x"` under dependencies
- Ensuring the `node_modules/@reclaimprotocol` directory exists in your project

### 3. Import the SDK

Add the following import statement to your Node.js application:

```javascript
const { ReclaimProofRequest } = require('@reclaimprotocol/js-sdk');
```
